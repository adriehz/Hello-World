# Hello-World
Following the guide 

I'm just following whatever the guide tells me to do. Right now it wants me to write something about myself so I will do so. 
There isn't really much to write about so I'll just leave this here in case it gets covered by anyone else but for the time being there is no other option available, this is just a test to start using GitHub since I've been meaning to do so for a long while now.
